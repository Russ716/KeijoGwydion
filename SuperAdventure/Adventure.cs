 Controls are the things you see on a program’s, or a website’s, screen – text, boxes to enter values, buttons. In Visual Studio, when you’re working with a form, you’ll see a list of controls on the left side. We’re going to use some of the common controls.

The first controls we’re going to add are “labels”. These are used when you want to display a small piece of text.
